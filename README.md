# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Toolkit for IntelliJ

## About

The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Toolkit for IntelliJ is an open source plug-in for the IntelliJ Integrated Development Environment (IDE) maintained by Oracle Corp.
The toolkit supports the Autonomous Database services. With Autonomous Database service support, users can create ATP/ADW instances, start/stop, terminate, clone, update licence type, change admin password, scale up/down, download client credentials (wallet) and create connection to their Autonomous Databases.
Once the connection is created to the Autonomous Database, users can browse through schema and tables.
It also supports switching between multiple accounts and regions.
